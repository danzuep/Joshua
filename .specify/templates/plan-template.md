# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Kotlin with Gradle, Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., JUnit, Espresso, Robolectric, pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Android API 19+, Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Build System**: [e.g., Gradle with Kotlin or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Dependency Injection**: [e.g., Dagger or Hilt or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**UI**: [e.g., Android Views or Compose or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  

<!--
### Development Workflow
- Feature development follows TDD: write tests first, then implement.
- Code reviews required for all changes, focusing on constitution compliance.
- Automated CI/CD with tests and linting gates.
- Release process documented in docs/RELEASING.md.
-->

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- High Code Quality: Feature design must include plans for comprehensive tests and adherence to Kotlin style guidelines.
- Modularity: Clear separation of concerns with defined interfaces for dependency injection.
- Simple and Predictable UX: User scenarios must be simple and predictable; include help text plans.
- Minimal Dependencies: No new dependencies unless justified; prefer standard Android libraries.
- Backward Compatibility: Ensure changes follow semantic versioning; plan data migrations if needed.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
